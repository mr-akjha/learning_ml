# ML Learning Roadmap

> From Laravel Developer to ML Practitioner

## Overview
- **Duration**: 12-16 weeks (flexible, at your pace)
- **Approach**: Learn by building, not just reading
- **Each module**: Concept → Code → Mini-project

---

## Phase 1: Python for ML (Week 1-2)
> Goal: Write Pythonic code confidently

| # | Topic | Laravel Parallel | Status |
|---|-------|------------------|--------|
| 1.1 | Lists, Dicts, Tuples | Arrays, Collections | ⬜ |
| 1.2 | List Comprehensions | Collection::map/filter | ⬜ |
| 1.3 | Functions & *args/**kwargs | PHP functions | ⬜ |
| 1.4 | Classes & OOP | Laravel Models/Services | ⬜ |
| 1.5 | File I/O & JSON | Storage facade, json_decode | ⬜ |
| 1.6 | Error Handling | try-catch, Exceptions | ⬜ |
| 1.7 | Virtual Environments | Composer | ⬜ |

**Mini-project**: Build a CLI data processor (like an Artisan command)

---

## Phase 2: NumPy - Numerical Computing (Week 3-4)
> Goal: Understand how ML libraries handle data internally

| # | Topic | Why It Matters | Status |
|---|-------|----------------|--------|
| 2.1 | Arrays vs Lists | Speed - ML needs fast math | ⬜ |
| 2.2 | Array Operations | Vectorization (no loops!) | ⬜ |
| 2.3 | Indexing & Slicing | Data selection | ⬜ |
| 2.4 | Broadcasting | Math on different shapes | ⬜ |
| 2.5 | Linear Algebra Basics | Foundation of ML algorithms | ⬜ |

**Mini-project**: Image manipulation with NumPy (images are just arrays!)

---

## Phase 3: Pandas - Data Manipulation (Week 5-7)
> Goal: Load, clean, transform any dataset

| # | Topic | Laravel Parallel | Status |
|---|-------|------------------|--------|
| 3.1 | DataFrames & Series | Eloquent Collection | ⬜ |
| 3.2 | Reading Data (CSV, JSON, SQL) | Model::all(), DB::table() | ⬜ |
| 3.3 | Selecting & Filtering | where(), select() | ⬜ |
| 3.4 | Grouping & Aggregation | groupBy(), sum(), avg() | ⬜ |
| 3.5 | Joining Data | Eloquent relationships | ⬜ |
| 3.6 | Handling Missing Data | nullable, default values | ⬜ |
| 3.7 | Data Cleaning | Validation, Transformers | ⬜ |

**Mini-project**: Analyze a real dataset (e.g., sales data, movie ratings)

---

## Phase 4: Data Visualization (Week 8)
> Goal: See patterns in data before modeling

| # | Topic | Use Case | Status |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 4.1 | Matplotlib Basics | Line, bar, scatter plots | ⬜ |
| 4.2 | Seaborn | Statistical visualizations | ⬜ |
| 4.3 | Exploratory Data Analysis | Understand your data | ⬜ |

**Mini-project**: Create a visual report from a dataset

---

## Phase 5: ML Fundamentals (Week 9-11)
> Goal: Understand how machines "learn"

| # | Topic | What You'll Learn | Status |
|---|-------|-------------------|--------|
| 5.1 | What is ML? | Types: Supervised, Unsupervised | ⬜ |
| 5.2 | Train/Test Split | Why we split data | ⬜ |
| 5.3 | Linear Regression | Predict numbers | ⬜ |
| 5.4 | Logistic Regression | Predict categories | ⬜ |
| 5.5 | Decision Trees | Visual, interpretable models | ⬜ |
| 5.6 | Model Evaluation | Accuracy, Precision, Recall | ⬜ |
| 5.7 | Overfitting & Underfitting | The core ML challenge | ⬜ |
| 5.8 | Cross-Validation | Robust evaluation | ⬜ |

**Mini-project**: Predict house prices (classic ML problem)

---

## Phase 6: Real ML Project (Week 12-14)
> Goal: End-to-end ML workflow

| # | Step | Description | Status |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 6.1 | Problem Definition | What are we predicting? | ⬜ |
| 6.2 | Data Collection | Get/find a dataset | ⬜ |
| 6.3 | EDA | Explore & visualize | ⬜ |
| 6.4 | Data Preprocessing | Clean & prepare | ⬜ |
| 6.5 | Feature Engineering | Create useful features | ⬜ |
| 6.6 | Model Selection | Try multiple algorithms | ⬜ |
| 6.7 | Hyperparameter Tuning | Optimize performance | ⬜ |
| 6.8 | Final Evaluation | Test set performance | ⬜ |
| 6.9 | Documentation | Explain your work | ⬜ |

**Project ideas**:
- Customer churn prediction
- Spam classifier
- Movie recommendation system
- Credit risk assessment

## Phase 7: Beyond Basics (Week 15+)
> Choose your path

| Path | Topics | Good For |
|------|--------|----------|
| Deep Learning | Neural Networks, PyTorch/TensorFlow | Images, Text, Complex patterns |
| NLP | Text processing, Transformers | Chatbots, Sentiment analysis |
| Computer Vision | Image classification, Object detection | Image apps |
| MLOps | Deployment, APIs, Monitoring | Production ML (your backend skills shine!) |
