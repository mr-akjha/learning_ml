    "Don't worry - we're keeping this **practical, not theoretical**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why it matters: Every ML algorithm uses linear algebra under the hood.\n",
    "- **Linear Regression**: finding the best weights (dot products)\n",
    "- **Neural Networks**: matrix multiplications at every layer\n",
    "- **Recommendations**: matrix factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to be a math expert, but understanding these basics will help you **debug and understand** what's happening.\n",

    "### PHP Parallel\n",
    "Think of it this way: in Laravel, you don't write raw SQL for everything - Eloquent handles it. Similarly, scikit-learn handles the linear algebra for you. But understanding the basics (like understanding SQL) makes you much more effective."
